\title{Open a Microsoft Excel file (xls/xlsx) or an openxlsx Workbook}
\usage{
openXL(file=NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{path to the Excel (xls/xlsx) file or Workbook object.}
}
\description{
This function tries to open a Microsoft Excel
(xls/xlsx) file or an openxlsx Workbook with the proper
application, in a portable manner.

In Windows (c) and Mac (c), it uses system default handlers,
given the file type.

In Linux it searches (via \code{which}) for available xls/xlsx
reader applications (unless \code{options('openxlsx.excelApp')}
is set to the app bin path), and if it finds anything, sets
\code{options('openxlsx.excelApp')} to the program choosen by
the user via a menu (if many are present, otherwise it will
set the only available). Currently searched for apps are
Libreoffice/Openoffice (\code{soffice} bin), Gnumeric
(\code{gnumeric}) and Calligra Sheets (\code{calligrasheets}).
